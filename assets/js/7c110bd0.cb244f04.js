The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted. The algorithm, which is a comparison sort, is named for the way smaller elements \'bubble\' to the top of the list. Although the algorithm is simple, it is too slow and impractical for most problems even when compared to insertion sort. It can be practical if the input is usually in sort order but may occasionally have some out-of-order elements nearly in position.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"dsa/arrays/arrays-in-dsa":{"id":"dsa/arrays/arrays-in-dsa","title":"Arrays in Data Structures and Algorithms","description":"An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations.

It repeatedly finds the minimum element from the unsorted part and puts it at the beginning of the unsorted part. The algorithm maintains two subarrays in a given array. The subarray which is already sorted and the remaining subarray which is unsorted. In every iteration of selection sort, the minimum element from the unsorted subarray is picked and moved to the sorted subarray.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"dsa/basic-concepts/space-complexity":{"id":"dsa/basic-concepts/space-complexity","title":"Space Complexity","description":"Space complexity is a measure of the amount of working storage an algorithm needs.
